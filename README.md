## 3D <-> 2D Math: Coordinate Conversion

This project relies on precise math to convert between 3D coordinates (on a sphere) and 2D screen/image coordinates. This is essential for mapping hotspots between the 3D scene and their 2D image representation.

### 1. 2D â†’ 3D: `convert2Dto3D`
Converts 2D screen percentage coordinates (from a 2D image) into 3D coordinates.

**Explanation:**
- Converts 2D image coordinates (as %) (0,100) to normalized device coordinates (NDC) [-1, 1]
- The coordinats are in [-1,1] range.
- Screen coordinates are from (0,0) to (100,100)
- Normalized Device Coordinates: (-1,-1) to (1,1)
- Calculating:
  - ndc= (v / 100) * 2 - 1
  - 0% -> -1
  - 50% -> 0
  - 100% -> 1
  - norm value = ((original value - a) / (b - a)) * (d - c) + c
  - original range: [a,b] = [0, 100]
  - target range: [c, d] = [-1, 1]
- ndcX = (xPercent / 100) * 2 - 1; // from [0,100] -> [-1,1]
- ndcY = -((yPercent / 100) * 2 - 1); 
- Same calculation for Y
  - Y is flipped.
  - yPercent = 0 -> ndcY = 1 (TOP)
  - yPercent = 100 -> ndcY = -1 (BOTTOM)

### 2. 3D â†’ 2D: `convert3Dto2D`
Converts 3D coordinates on the sphere to 2D screen percentage coordinates (for overlaying on a 2D image).

**Explanation:**
- Projects a 3D point to NDC using the camera
- Converts NDC [-1,1] to percentage [0,100] for both axes
- Y axis is flipped to match image coordinates
- ndcX -1 (left) -> 0%, 1 (right) -> 100%
- ndcY 1 (top) -> 0%, 0 (bottom) -> 100%
- Calculation:
  - xPercent = ((ndcX + 1) / 2) * 100
  - yPercent = ((-ndcY + 1) / 2) * 100
  - both projected values from [-1, 1] to [0, 2] but dividing by 2
  - Scales them to [0, 1]
  - minus flips y so top is 0 and bottom is 100
